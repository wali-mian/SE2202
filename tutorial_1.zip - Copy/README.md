# Tutorial 1 (Score out of 100)

In this tutorial you will ensure you have visual studio code and node.js properly installed and upload a file to gradescope.

## Task 1 (Ungraded)

Install [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

## Task 2 (100 points toal)

Download the file from the course website called tutorial_1.zip . If desired, open the instructions (identical to those on OWL) in README.md in visual studio code and view using ctrl + shift + v. Open the file tutorial_1.js . Fill in the missing line and&nbsp;do not&nbsp;change the exiting output line. (50 points for correct output)

Upload to [gradescope](https://guides.gradescope.com/hc/en-us/articles/21865616724749-Submitting-a-Code-assignment). You must submit to gradescope through Github.
    1. [Link your Github account to Gradescope](https://guides.gradescope.com/hc/en-us/articles/21587275611533-Linking-and-Unlinking-Accounts). Course staff will view your submissions through Gradescope, but will be able to see your Github name, so make a new account if desired.
    2. [Create a repository on Github](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository) for your assignment. The upload should work even if you would like to make your repository private.
    3. [Add your file](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/adding-a-file-to-a-repository) you made and be sure to check that you have committed and pushed the change. The file **must** be named tutorial1Solution.js (for the autograder). It must be in the root of the respository (not in a folder) for the autograder to recognize it.
    4. [Submit to Gradescope](https://guides.gradescope.com/hc/en-us/articles/21865616724749-Submitting-a-Code-assignment) by choosing the repository.
    5. Check the autograded output. You may resubmit using the same steps as many times as needed, as long as you are before the deadline.

 (50 points for file upload, no points for output if file not uploaded correctly)
