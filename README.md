# Tutorial 4

## Gradescope instructions:

Solution filenames should be:
varAndScopeSolution.js (Task 1)
closuresSolution.js (Task 2)


## Task 1: Var and Scope

The goal of this task is to demostrate global, function, and block scope, as well as show how variables declared with var can be redefined.

Fill in the variables to give the correct output, and be careful to check that you get 4 output lines (because some statements are separated by other code).

## Task 2: Closures

The goal of this task is to practice working with closures. The file closures.js contains the starter code for this task. Complete the code according to the instructions in the comments.

## Grading

Autograder: 40 / 100 Points
**Do not** deliberately write output code to fool the autograder (such as by hardcoding output rather than calling the function). This will result in a grade of 0 for the assignment.

Following instructions: 60/100 Points
Follow the instructions in the assignment. If you are asked to produce an outcome using a particular technique marks will be lost for using the a different technique that produces the same outcome, because the goal is to practice concepts.
